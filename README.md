# Sorting Algorithms

Visualising various sorting algorithms using Python and Tkinter.

(The following images are for illustrative purposes only)

## Selection Sort

Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(nÂ²) timc complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Wikipedia

Worst complexity: n^2
Average complexity: n^2
Best complexity: n^2
Space complexity: 1
Method: Selection
Stable: No
Class: Comparison sort

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Wikipedia

Worst complexity: n^2
Average complexity: n^2
Best complexity: n
Space complexity: 1
Method: Exchanging
Stable: Yes
Class: Comparison sort

## Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. Wikipedia

Worst complexity: n^2
Average complexity: n^2
Best complexity: n
Space complexity: 1
Method: Insertion
Stable: Yes
Class: Comparison sort
